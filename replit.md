COMPLETED: Comprehensive Accounting Transactions Business Context Enforcement - implemented mandatory business context validation for merchants (Role ID 2) across all accounting transaction endpoints. Enhanced LIST endpoint with required x-selected-business-id header validation for merchants returning 400 error when missing. SINGLE endpoint already had comprehensive business context validation with triple-layer validation (mandatory header, transaction ownership, business access). CREATE endpoint now enforces mandatory business context for merchants with explicit role validation. Fixed foreign key constraint issue by implementing person.id to user.id mapping logic in frontend form submission (person 565 → user 551). System now provides complete multi-tenant data isolation for accounting transactions with proper error handling and business access validation across all CRUD operations.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Accounting Transactions Categories Integration and UI Consistency - successfully populated accounting transaction categories dropdown in both create (/accounting-transactions/new) and edit (/accounting-transactions/edit/:id) forms. Categories endpoint properly returns business-scoped data with 10 sample categories for business 38 (Office Supplies, Marketing & Advertising, Equipment & Tools, Professional Services, Utilities, Travel & Transportation, Training & Education, Insurance, Rent & Facilities, Software & Subscriptions). Updated both accounting-form.tsx and accounting-list.tsx to use consistent p-6 padding instead of py-6 for improved content spacing across all accounting transaction views. Form dropdowns now correctly display all available categories with proper business context filtering.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Decimal Amount Support Implementation for Accounting Transactions - enhanced amount field validation to accept decimal numbers with both comma (39,70) and dot (39.70) separators. Updated frontend form schema with refined validation using parseFloat normalization and helpful placeholder text "Ex: 39.70 or 39,70". Modified backend insertAccountingTransactionSchema to handle both string and number inputs with automatic comma-to-dot transformation. Fixed form submission logic in both create and update mutations to properly normalize comma-separated decimals before API calls. System now fully supports European decimal format (comma separator) while maintaining compatibility with standard dot notation, providing seamless user experience for international decimal input formats.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Accounting Transaction Enum Validation Fix - resolved form validation error by updating form schema from 'income' enum value to 'revenue' to match database schema. Fixed SelectItem values to use 'revenue'/'expense' instead of 'income'/'expense'. Updated form default values and type casting logic to handle 'revenue' enum properly. Backend schema already supported correct enum values; frontend now properly aligned with database constraints. Form submissions now validate successfully without enum mismatch errors.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Accounting Transaction URL Standardization and Routing Fix - standardized accounting transaction URLs to match other modules' patterns, changing from `/accounting-form` and `/accounting-form/:id` to `/accounting-transactions/new` and `/accounting-transactions/edit/:id`. Updated App.tsx routing configuration to support both old and new URL patterns for backward compatibility. Fixed accounting-list.tsx navigation links to use correct URLs for create and edit operations. Updated dashboard quick actions to use `/accounting-transactions/new` URL. Enhanced accounting-form.tsx to handle both `:id` and `:transactionId` route parameters for compatibility. Verified complete CRUD functionality: list (business-filtered), create (standardized URL), edit (standardized URL), and delete operations all working correctly. System now provides consistent URL patterns across all modules (appointments, clients, services, accounting transactions, etc.) for better user experience and maintainability.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Login Data Caching Prevention Implementation - implemented comprehensive cache clearing system to ensure fresh data loads on every login. Updated login page to disable query caching with staleTime: 0, gcTime: 0, and refetchOnMount: true for user businesses query. Added queryClient.clear() call during credentials validation to eliminate all cached data before business selection. Enhanced login flow to guarantee completely fresh data loads for each user session without persistence of previous user's data. System prevents cached data from displaying incorrect information when switching between different user accounts.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Comprehensive Merchant Sample Data Creation and 404 Resolution - fixed React Query URL construction preventing 404 errors for individual resources by updating query client to properly handle business-scoped endpoints. Created comprehensive sample data for business 38 including 4 services, 3 clients, 4 appointments, 3 support tickets, 6 accounting transactions, 3 payment gateways, 1 WhatsApp instance, and 3 barber plans. Resolved merchant 404 "Not Found" errors when accessing individual resources through improved endpoint pattern matching. Merchants now see populated data lists instead of empty arrays and can successfully edit individual resources without URL construction errors.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Final Staff List Super Admin Access Fix - completed comprehensive Super Admin unrestricted access implementation across ALL list endpoints. Fixed staff-list.tsx by adding useAuth hook from @/lib/auth and updating enabled condition to (user?.isSuperAdmin || !!selectedBusinessId). Verified Array.isArray() safety checks prevent runtime errors. All major endpoints now work for Super Admin without business selection: Appointments, Accounting, Clients, Staff, Payment Gateways, WhatsApp Instances, Services, Support Tickets. System provides complete multi-tenant isolation for merchants while maintaining Super Admin global access privileges across all business data.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Fixed Super Admin List Access and Runtime Errors - resolved "clients.filter is not a function" runtime error by adding null checks to frontend filter operations. Updated client-list and service-list components to allow Super Admin data access without requiring business selection. Added useAuth imports and enabled conditions (user?.isSuperAdmin || !!selectedBusinessId) to permit Super Admin unrestricted access. Fixed query client parameterized URL construction for business forms. System eliminates frontend crashes and allows Super Admin to view all data across businesses while maintaining business context filtering for merchants.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Fixed Super Admin Business Form Authentication and Query Logic - resolved 401 authentication errors preventing business edit form data loading. Converted business form from session-based to JWT Bearer authentication. Fixed query client parameterized URL construction to properly handle queryKey arrays like ["/api/businesses", id] by building URLs dynamically. Updated business form queries to use default JWT authentication instead of custom fetch with credentials. System now correctly fetches individual business data (/api/businesses/38) instead of all businesses (/api/businesses) for edit forms. Business edit forms properly populate all input fields with authentic business data for Super Admin users.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Fixed Frontend LIST ALL Endpoints Business Context for Merchants - resolved critical business context validation issues affecting all merchant LIST operations. Fixed middleware business filtering logic to properly handle NaN values and invalid business IDs. Corrected appointment edit form URL parameter mismatch (route used :id but form accessed appointmentId). Enhanced business context middleware with better validation and debugging. Verified all LIST endpoints (Staff, Clients, Services, Appointments, Payment Gateways, WhatsApp Instances, Support Tickets, Accounting Transactions) now work correctly for merchants with proper business-scoped data filtering. System eliminates "Access denied to selected business" errors and empty array responses for authorized merchant operations across all modules.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Comprehensive Appointment Form Business Context Integration - fixed frontend appointment edit form to properly load business-scoped data (clients, staff, services) and correctly pre-select values when editing appointments. Updated appointment-list.tsx to use default query function with business context headers, resolving 400 HTTP errors. Fixed person_id/user_id mapping issue in staff dropdown selection ensuring appointments save with correct staff member references. Enhanced form mutations with proper business context cache invalidation. System now provides complete multi-tenant appointment CRUD functionality with proper business context isolation for merchants while maintaining data integrity across all operations.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Fixed Appointment Single Resource Business Context Validation - corrected /api/appointments/:id endpoint to properly validate that appointment ID belongs to selected business context. Enhanced validation logic ensures that when business context header is provided, the appointment MUST belong to that business regardless of user role. System now prevents merchants from accessing appointment 317 (business 35) when providing business context 37 with proper 403 error. Super Admin maintains unrestricted access without business context OR filtered access with business context validation. Fixed business ID and appointment ID relationship validation for complete multi-tenant isolation in single resource access.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Comprehensive Appointment Business Context Validation for CREATE/UPDATE Operations - implemented complete business context validation ensuring user_id (staff), service_id, and client_id all belong to selected business context during appointment creation and updates. Fixed validation logic to properly handle person ID vs user ID mapping for staff member validation through user-business relationships. System validates: 1) Service belongs to selected business (prevents cross-business service usage), 2) Staff member belongs to selected business through user-business association, 3) Client belongs to selected business through user-business association. Prevents appointment creation with service 205 (business 35) when business context is 37. Both CREATE and UPDATE operations enforce strict multi-tenant data integrity preventing cross-business data references in appointment records.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Enhanced Appointments Single Resource Business Context Validation - implemented comprehensive business context validation for /api/appointments/:id endpoint ensuring both Super Admin and Merchants are validated when business context is provided. Super Admin can access appointments without business context (unrestricted) OR with business context (validates appointment belongs to selected business with 403 error for mismatches). Merchants require explicit x-selected-business-id header with triple-layer validation: 1) Mandatory header check (400 error if missing), 2) Appointment business context validation (403 error if appointment doesn't belong to selected business), 3) Business access authorization (403 error if merchant unauthorized for selected business). System prevents merchants from accessing appointment 317 (business 35) when providing divergent business context 37. Appointments single resource endpoint now matches Services endpoint behavior with complete business context isolation.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Corrected Appointments LIST ALL Business Context Logic - implemented proper business context behavior for appointments list endpoint matching other endpoints (Clients, Services). Super Admin can access appointments without business ID (shows all appointments across all businesses) OR with business ID (filtered to specific business). Merchants require explicit x-selected-business-id header for appointments access. System enforces: 1) Super Admin unrestricted access without business context OR filtered access with business context, 2) Merchant mandatory business header validation (400 error if missing), 3) Merchant business access authorization (403 error if unauthorized). Verified functionality: Super Admin sees all appointments without header, filtered appointments with header; merchants get 400 error without header, 403 for unauthorized business, successful filtered data with authorized business. Appointments LIST now matches standard multi-tenant behavior across the system.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Comprehensive Strict Business Context Validation for ALL Single Resource Endpoints - implemented complete business context enforcement for merchants (Role ID 2) across ALL single resource GET endpoints (9 total). Enhanced /api/staff/:id, /api/clients/:id, /api/services/:id, /api/appointments/:id, /api/accounting-transactions/:id, /api/payment-gateways/:id, /api/support-tickets/:id, /api/whatsapp-instances/:id, and /api/barber-plans/:id with triple-layer validation: 1) Mandatory x-selected-business-id header (400 error if missing), 2) Resource must belong to selected business context (403 error if mismatch), 3) Merchant must have access to selected business (403 error if unauthorized). Fixed Services endpoint business context application issue where merchants could access authorized business resources without explicit business selection. System now enforces absolute multi-tenant data isolation - merchants can ONLY access individual resources when proper business context is explicitly selected and validated. Super Admin maintains unrestricted access. Verified complete functionality: merchants receive proper error messages for missing context, wrong context, and unauthorized business access, with successful data retrieval only when all validations pass.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Comprehensive Business Context Implementation and Database Error Prevention - fixed critical database errors affecting merchants by adding ID parameter validation to ALL GET by ID endpoints (8 endpoints total). Implemented strict business context filtering across ALL API endpoints, fixing Services endpoint that was incorrectly returning business_id: null records to merchants. Added validation preventing "/api/clients/null" type requests that caused PostgreSQL crashes. Updated getServicesByBusinessIds storage method to enforce strict business isolation. Verified complete business context functionality: merchants (Role ID 2) now properly access only their authorized business data across all 9 major endpoints (Staff, Clients, Services, Appointments, Accounting, Payment Gateways, WhatsApp, Support Tickets, Barber Plans) with proper empty arrays for missing data instead of 500 errors. System maintains complete multi-tenant data isolation while preventing database crashes from invalid frontend parameters.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Comprehensive Universal Business ID Validation System - implemented mandatory business_id validation for ALL create operations across entire API. Updated 8 critical endpoints (Clients, Staff, Services, Accounting Transactions, Payment Gateways, Support Tickets, WhatsApp Instances, Barber Plans) to require explicit business_id in request body or x-selected-business-id header for ALL users including Super Admin. System eliminates business_id defaults and enforces deliberate business context selection for every create operation. Non-Super Admin users maintain existing business access validation. System prevents accidental cross-business data creation while preserving flexible dual-source business_id validation (body OR header). All create operations now return 400 error when business_id missing: "Business ID is required in request body or x-selected-business-id header". Verified functionality: Services endpoint properly blocks creation without business_id and succeeds with valid business_id.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Services Business Integrity Protection - implemented strict business transfer prevention ensuring services cannot be moved between businesses during updates. Added validation logic preventing business_id changes in existing services with clear error messaging. System maintains business data isolation while allowing normal updates within original business context. Users can update service properties using x-selected-business-id header without requiring explicit business_id in request body. Business transfer attempts return 400 error: "Cannot change business_id of existing service. Services must remain in their original business."
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Flexible Business ID Validation System - implemented comprehensive business_id validation supporting both request body and x-selected-business-id header for Staff and Services endpoints. Updated POST/PUT operations to accept business_id from either source, providing flexibility for frontend business context and direct API usage. System validates business access using fresh database lookups for Role ID 2 users. Multi-business users can now operate across all authorized businesses (35, 37) with proper 400/403 error handling. Error messages clearly indicate both validation sources available. Frontend integration seamless with existing selectedBusinessId header system.
- June 22, 2025. COMPLETED: Services Component Business Context Integration - implemented comprehensive business-scoped data access for Services CRUD operations. Updated service-form.tsx to use business context instead of hardcoded business_id, added business context validation for form submission, and integrated selectedBusinessId throughout create/update mutations. Added business context protection preventing form access without selected business. Backend already properly handles business filtering through getBusinessFilter middleware. Verified complete CRUD functionality: list (business-filtered), create (business_id 35), update (business context validation), and delete (204 status) all working correctly with merchant role restrictions.
- June 21, 2025. COMPLETED: Super Admin Universal Access Restoration - fixed "No business access" errors affecting Super Admin across all API endpoints including Services, Clients, and Staff modules. Updated business access validation logic in 6 endpoints to properly check Super Admin privileges before applying business context restrictions. Super Admin now has unrestricted access to view, create, edit, and delete all data across all businesses while maintaining strict business-scoped security for merchants and other roles. System preserves multi-tenant isolation for non-Super Admin users while restoring full administrative privileges.
- June 21, 2025. COMPLETED: Comprehensive Staff Management Business Access Control - implemented strict business-scoped access validation for staff creation and editing endpoints. Added JWT authentication and business access validation to POST /api/staff and PUT /api/staff/:id endpoints. Merchants (Role ID 2) can now only create and edit staff in businesses they have access to, with 403 errors for unauthorized business access attempts. System fetches fresh business associations from database for merchants to handle dynamic business relationships. Verified merchants with businesses [24, 35, 36] are properly blocked from accessing business 25 and allowed to access business 24.
- June 21, 2025. COMPLETED: Fixed Staff Endpoint Duplicate Records Issue - resolved duplicate staff records problem in /api/staff endpoint for merchants with multiple business access. Updated getPersonsByRolesAndBusiness storage method to implement application-level deduplication using array filtering by person ID. Merchants now receive unique staff records instead of identical duplicates for each business association. System maintains proper business-scoped access control while eliminating data redundancy.
- June 21, 2025. COMPLETED: Comprehensive Business-Scoped Access Control for Merchants - implemented strict business context filtering for merchants (Role ID 2) across ALL API endpoints. Updated middleware to automatically provide merchants access to all their business IDs when no specific business is selected. Fixed business filtering discrepancy by ensuring merchants see all their associated businesses consistently between API calls and SaaS application. Added JWT authentication and business access validation to /api/businesses/:id endpoint to prevent merchants from viewing individual business details they don't own. Merchants now can only view, edit, and delete data (staff, clients, appointments, services, accounting, settings, etc.) from businesses they own. System enforces complete multi-tenant data isolation for merchant users across all modules while maintaining Super Admin global access privileges.
- June 20, 2025. COMPLETED: Role-Based Business Management Access Control - implemented comprehensive role-based access control for business management operations. Super Admin (Role ID 1) can create, edit, and delete all businesses. Merchant (Role ID 2) can only edit their own businesses, cannot create new ones. Other roles (employee, client, financials) cannot manage businesses at all. Updated API endpoints (/api/businesses POST/PUT/DELETE) with JWT authentication and proper role validation. Frontend business list now conditionally shows create/edit/delete buttons based on user permissions. System enforces strict business management hierarchy for multi-tenant SaaS security.
- June 20, 2025. COMPLETED: Complete Translation Helper System Implementation - systematically implemented translation helper (useTranslationHelper hook + createTranslationHelper function) across all 25+ page components. Replaced TranslatableText with t() function for form validation messages, toast notifications, and HTML placeholder attributes to resolve TypeScript errors. Implemented placeholder translation for HTML attributes (placeholder={t("text")}) across 11+ form components. Created unified translation approach: TranslatableText for visible UI content, translation helper for validation/toast/placeholder messages. System now provides consistent multi-language support across all forms, notifications, placeholders, and user feedback messages without JSX compatibility issues.
- June 20, 2025. COMPLETED: Immediate Language Switching System - implemented instant language application when users change settings. System now updates localStorage (x-selected-business-language, traductions-selected-language) and sessionStorage immediately, triggers automatic translation loading, and refreshes page to apply changes instantly. Fixed TranslatableText component to use business language context instead of individual API calls, enabling proper edition mode with pen icons for non-English languages only. Language changes in settings now apply immediately without manual refresh.
- June 20, 2025. COMPLETED: Business Language Context System implementation - created comprehensive business language loading system that automatically loads business default language from settings table after business selection. Implemented localStorage and sessionStorage for x-selected-business-language persistence, created BusinessLanguageProvider with bulk translation loading via /api/translations/bulk endpoint, updated useBusinessContext hook to automatically load business language settings, integrated business language system into login process, and created new TranslatableText component that uses business language context. System now provides automatic multi-language support based on each business's default language configuration with efficient bulk loading of all translations in one API call.
- June 20, 2025. COMPLETED: Comprehensive frontend Business Context ID filtering implementation across ALL component query keys - systematically updated all list components (staff-list, client-list, appointment-list, service-list, accounting-list, whatsapp-list, payment-gateway-list, support-ticket-list, barber-plan-list, settings) to include selectedBusinessId in React Query keys and enable proper data isolation. Added useBusinessContext() hook to all components, implemented enabled: !!selectedBusinessId conditions, and updated all cache invalidation calls. Frontend now enforces strict business context filtering matching backend implementation for complete multi-business SaaS data isolation.
- June 19, 2025. COMPLETED: Comprehensive business filtering implementation across ALL API endpoints - systematically updated all remaining endpoints (staff, clients, appointments, services, accounting-transactions, accounting-transaction-categories, whatsapp-instances, payment-gateways, support-tickets, barber-plans) to enforce strict business context validation. Non-Super Admin users without selected business ID now receive 400/403 errors or empty arrays. Super Admin retains special privilege to access all data when no business context is selected (businessIds === null). All API endpoints now enforce mandatory business context for proper multi-business SaaS data isolation.
- June 19, 2025. Fixed business context provider hierarchy issues - added error handling to all components using useBusinessContext (Dashboard, EditionProvider, TranslationCacheProvider, BusinessChangeButton, TranslatableText) to prevent context access errors during early rendering phases. Business context now works properly across all components.
- June 19, 2025. Implemented bulk translation loading system - replaced dozens of individual API calls with single efficient /api/translations/bulk endpoint. Created TranslationCacheProvider to cache all 1,231 strings at once and updated TranslatableText to use cached translations for instant display. Fixed provider hierarchy (EditionProvider before TranslationCacheProvider) to resolve context access issues. System now loads all Portuguese translations in one request instead of making 20+ individual calls on each page load.
- June 19, 2025. Successfully fixed provider hierarchy and language detection system - moved BusinessProvider before EditionProvider in App.tsx to enable proper business context access in translation system. Portuguese translations now load correctly based on business settings with automatic language detection from business configuration. Fixed localStorage persistence and session restoration for seamless user experience across page refreshes.
- June 19, 2025. Fixed persistence issue where selected language and business information were lost on page refresh (F5) by implementing proper localStorage restoration with user-specific keys and automatic business selection for single-business users. Translation system now maintains language settings across browser refresh.
- June 19, 2025. Implemented automatic language detection from business settings - SaaS now displays all strings in the language configured in business settings automatically, without requiring edition mode activation. Translation system loads appropriate language based on business configuration and falls back to English when translations are unavailable.
- June 19, 2025. Fixed DOM manipulation errors in TranslatableText components - resolved circular rendering issues by removing JSX elements from navigation constants and replacing toast messages with plain strings instead of TranslatableText components.
- June 19, 2025. Completed final comprehensive TranslatableText string audit and database update - performed another complete codebase scan and bulk inserted 236 additional missing strings into traductions table. Database now contains 1,231 total English strings, representing 100% coverage of all TranslatableText wrapped content across the entire application including forms, notifications, validation messages, UI elements, error messages, and success confirmations. Translation system is fully synchronized with codebase.
- June 19, 2025. Removed auto-login functionality to allow switching between different user accounts after logout - login page now requires manual credentials entry for all users in both development and production environments.
- June 19, 2025. Fixed Super Admin business selection modal issue - updated business selector modal to use correct API endpoint (/api/businesses) for Super Admin users instead of /api/user-businesses, ensuring all 4 businesses are visible during business selection instead of just 1. Server-side logic was working correctly; frontend was using wrong endpoint due to hardcoded query key.
- June 19, 2025. Implemented session persistence to maintain user authentication across browser refreshes - JWT tokens are now validated on app initialization and user session is restored automatically, eliminating the need to re-login after page refresh.
- June 19, 2025. Enhanced Translation Management page layout to occupy 100% of content area and added comprehensive pagination with 10-25-50-100 rows per page options, persistent settings, and smart navigation controls for handling 755+ translatable strings efficiently.
